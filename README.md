# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset of transaction records. The model is built using **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** and is trained to classify transactions as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a model that can detect fraudulent transactions in a given credit card dataset. The model is based on **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** and uses various techniques for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training to achieve high accuracy in fraud detection.

## Dataset

The dataset contains features related to customer transactions, such as:

- **TransactionAmount**: Amount of the transaction.
- **TransactionDate**: Date and time of the transaction.
- **Location**: Geographic location of the transaction.
- **TransactionType**: Type of transaction (purchase, refund, etc.).
- **Label**: Whether the transaction is fraudulent or not (1 for fraud, 0 for non-fraud).

### Dataset Source
You can upload your own dataset or use a standard dataset such as `Kaggle's Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset` or any other similar dataset.

## Steps Involved

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- **Handling Missing Data**: The dataset is checked for null values, and appropriate imputation or removal is done.
- **Removing Duplicates**: Duplicate records are removed.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Non-numerical columns like `TransactionType`, `Location`, etc., are encoded using Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding.
- **Outlier Handling**: Outliers in numerical features (e.g., `Amount`, `TransactionTime`) are treated to avoid bias in the model.
  
### 2. **Feature Engineering**
- **Temporal Features**: Extracting features like the **hour**, **day**, and **weekend** from the `TransactionDate` column.
- **Geographical Features**: If `Location` is included, geographical information is encoded or removed based on model performance.

### 3. **Model Building**
- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**: A simple ANN model is built with:
  - Input layer corresponding to the number of features.
  - Hidden layers with **ReLU activation** functions.
  - Output layer with a **sigmoid activation** function for binary classification (fraud or non-fraud).
  
- **Compilation**: The model is compiled using the **Adam optimizer** and **binary crossentropy loss** for classification tasks.

### 4. **Model Training and Evaluation**
- The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
- The model is trained for multiple epochs (e.g., 20 epochs) with a batch size of 32.
- The model's performance is evaluated using **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.

### 5. **Class Imbalance Handling**
- Techniques like **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) are used to handle class imbalance between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For data preprocessing, model evaluation, and metrics.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd credit-card-fraud-detection
   ```

3. Place the dataset (`credit_card_fraud_dataset.csv`) in the project directory.

4. Run the notebook or script to preprocess the data, build the model, and train it:
   ```bash
   python fraud_detection_model.py
   ```

5. After training, the model will output the **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score** on the test dataset.

## Example Output

```plaintext
Model Accuracy: 98.2%
Confusion Matrix:
[[5000   10]
 [  15  100]]
Precision for fraud: 0.91
Recall for fraud: 0.87
F1 Score for fraud: 0.89
```
